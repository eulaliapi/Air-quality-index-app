# Air Quality Index App
This app has been created using the [Open Weather Map](https://openweathermap.org/) API [Air Pollution](https://openweathermap.org/api/air-pollution).

## How it works

Its functionality is simple: the users have the opportunity to click the link displayed at the beginning to get the air quality index of their position, but they can also get the same information about a city which they can enter in the search bar.

The card will display an emoji which describes the AQI in a figurative way followed by a short text that describes in words what it represents.
